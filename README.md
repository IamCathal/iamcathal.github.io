My portfolio website built mostly using bootstrap and a tiny bit of lingering JQuery. I'm not a front end dev so expect to see some horrible workarounds for styling everywhere in the code. But hey, it work's in the end so I don't really mind


I'm not using a template for my site but if you love it so much that you'd like to use it yourself all I ask is that you credit me somewhere.
